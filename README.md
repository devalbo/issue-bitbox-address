This repo contains code that demonstrates a mismatch between addresses generated by Bitbox and recorded by the BitDB database when using testnet. This is an issue because if I'm writing an application that sends a transaction from an address and I want to search for it on BitDb based on that address, this is not possible.

The *index.js* file contains code to go through the following steps. Note that several files are created to aid reproducibility and show what is happening at each step.
* use *HDNode* Bitbox library to create a private key and corresponding address - these are recorded in _wallet.json_
* use the saved key and address to create and transmit a memo post with a current timestamp - the TXID is recorded as well in _memo.json_
* create a BitDB query based on the TXID to load the transaction with the memo post's TXID
* execute the query; it seems like the bitdb endpoint only returns the TX when it has been confirmed
* compare the bitdb's response address (used as the first input address) to the address used when sending the memo post


I suspect this issue may only affect testnet addresses and could be related to this issue reported earlier: https://github.com/Bitcoin-com/bitbox-sdk/issues/41

Something else to note is that both addresses resolve to the same address history in the Bitcoin.com block explorer, so I'm not sure what's going on there, either. Additionally, the BitDb address gets transformed to the Bitsocket address.Examples:
